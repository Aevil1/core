# smart_contracts

This directory contains the smart contract implementations in header files starting with a capital letter. 

Further, it contain `qpi.h`, the Qubic Programming Interface for implementing the smart contracts.
It is available automatically in the smart contract implementation header files.

Other header files with starting with a lower case letter, such as `math_lib.h`, provide additional library functions that may be used in the smart contract implementation header files (for example, use `#include "math_lib.h"`).
